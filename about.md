Hi~ I'm Mark, a software developer and a Machine Learning enthusiast. I love everything about computer science, maths and physics. I currently work at MCA as a System Administrator. 

As a developer, I spend most of my spare time exploring new technologies. Most recently Iâ€™ve been interested in the potential and technology behind the Blockchain.
