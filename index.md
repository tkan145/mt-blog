# Software Imagineering
My name is  Mark Tran, a Software Developer and a Machine Learning enthusiast. I love everything about computer science, maths and physics. I currently work at MCA as a System Administrator.

As a developer, I spend most of my spare time exploring new technologies. Most recently Iâ€™ve been interested in the potential and technology behind the Blockchain.
